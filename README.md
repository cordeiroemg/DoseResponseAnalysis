# DoseResponseAnalysis

## Overview

`DoseResponseAnalysis` is a Python package designed for analyzing dose-response data commonly encountered in pharmacology, toxicology, and related fields. This package provides robust tools for fitting Hill curves to experimental data, calculating key metrics such as IC50 values, and generating informative visualizations. It includes methods for calculating confidence and fiducial intervals, allowing researchers to assess the uncertainty associated with their estimates.

## Features

- **Curve Fitting**: Fit dose-response curves using the Hill equation.
- **IC50 Calculation**: Automatically compute the IC50 and its confidence and fiducial intervals.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate plots to visualize dose-response relationships and fitted curves.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform significance checks and handle variability in experimental data.

## Installation

You can install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install DoseResponseAnalysis
